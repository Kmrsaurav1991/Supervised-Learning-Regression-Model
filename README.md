# Supervised-Learning-Regression-Model

Information about birth weight (birth weight) used to build a predictive model of continuous response variables. Analysis includes feature engineering, model preparation, variable selection, and model development.

There are following the regression models that were developed are:

. OLS Regression
. Lasso Regression
. Bayesian Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD)
. K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN)

 Below Step for run the all code go 
 1. Read file from excel file birthweight_low.xlsx .
 2. doc file Mobile App birthweight_data_dictionary.pdf ( information about all features).
 3. Jupiter required to run the Birthweight_Regression_Analysis.ipynb file.
 4. python file - Kernel-> Restart & RunAll.
 
 
The final output of the Jupyter notebook is a table of  candidate models showing the model type, training and test results, training test gaps, and  final model selection.
