# Supervised-Learning-Regression-Model




Information about birth weight (birth weight) used to build a predictive model of continuous response variables. Analysis includes feature engineering, model preparation, variable selection, and model development.

Below the regression models that were developed are:

1. OLS Regression
2. Lasso Regression
3. Bayesian Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD)
4. K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN)
The final output of the Jupyter notebook is a table of  candidate models showing the model type, training and test results, training test gaps, and  final model selection.

Step to run 

data in a excel file birthweight_low.xlsx
data dictionary in a doc file birthweight_data_dictionary.pdf ( information about all features)
Jupiter required for opening the Birthweight_Regression_Analysis.ipynb.
Below Step for run the all code go in to python file - Kernel-> Restart & RunAll
